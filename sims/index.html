<h2>Meteorology Simulations</h2>
<p>You can use the following simulations to demostrate the concepts of budgets, albedo and adiabatic processes.  
The simulations are freely available.  Each simulation is written in HTML5 and Javascript and will run in most modern browsers.</p>
<h3>Mountain Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity allows the user to adjust the initial temperature and vapor pressure of a parcel, 
denoted by a leaf, to observe how saturation occurs as the parcel travels over the mountain. 
The challenge for the user is hypothesize how these parameters affect when (where) saturation occurs to identify the 
variety of paths to saturation.

<h3>Radiation Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>Users collect temperature profile data for day and night in an environment 
that differs only by surface conditions. This activity is intended to be a puzzle since users are not 
expected to have yet been exposed to course materials that explain the profile differences. 
The challenge for the users is to list both what makes sense and what doesn't.</p>

<h3>Budget Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity challenges the users to hypothesize how input and output flows 
affect the water level in the tank over time. The input flow can be changed during predetermined time periods. 
The output flow is constant during the entire activity. 
The goal is for the user to construct rules that govern tank water level and are generally applicable to parameters 
other than water.</p>
